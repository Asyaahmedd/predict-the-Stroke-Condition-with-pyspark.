# Predict the stroke condition using pyspark

Stoke is a condition in which either the blood flow to the brain stops or blood flow is excessive. The stroke deprives person's brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause brain cells to die. With the advancement of technology in the medical field, predicting the occurrence of a stroke can be made using Machine Learning. The algorithms present in Machine Learning are constructive in making an accurate prediction and give correct analysis.

# Project objective

The aim of this project is to create a Logistic Regression Classifier to predict the Stroke Condition.
